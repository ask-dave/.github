## Ask Dave

This is a hobby project, with the goal of creating a (mostly) usable search engine from scratch

This has been imported from a monorepo, which i was using for around 2 weeks before github actions finally drove me insane (and i haven't even released anything yet) 

It is mainly written in go, with the frontend in vuejs
(This is my first time using go, so my code may be a bit dodgy)
